    "All data problems begin with a question and end with a narrative construct that provides a clear answer. From there, the next step is getting your data. As a Data Scientist, you'll spend an incredible amount of time and skills on acquiring, prepping, cleaning, and normalizing your data. In this tutorial, we'll review some of the best tools used in the rhelm of data acquisition. \n",

    "### Data Acquisition\n",

    "Data Acquisition is the process of getting your data, hence the term <i>acquisition</i>. Data doesn't come out of nowhere, so the very first step of any data science problem is going to be getting the data in the first place. \n",

    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the data, it might not be in the best format to work with. You might have scraped a bunch of data from a website, but need it in the form of a dataframe to work with it in an easier manner. This process is called data preparation - preparing your data in a format that's easiest to form with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your data is being stored or handled in a proper manner, that might still not be enough. You might have missing values or values that need normalizing. These inconsistencies that you fix before analysis refers to data cleaning. \n"
